orders of business (when i find motivation):
1. fix newvarcheck system (VERY IMPORTANT / FIRST PRIORITY / URGENT / POTENTIALLY GAME-BREAKING POST-FIRST UPD)
2. fix &cent; panel showing prematurely
3. clean up / fix base &cent; code
4. add separate cooldown timer for &cent; panel
5. create &cent; shop
6. create buttons 21 - 25
7. create ^ (levels) panel
8. create a few buttons after ^ panel for content
9. create a few working ^ milestones
   - idea: button index

that's all, folks!
